# Web Dev Toolkit â€“ Advanced Full-Stack Developer Handbook

**Web Dev Toolkit** is a personal knowledge base curated by [Ansh] ( https://github.com/ansh-Bytes217 )focused on mastering the modern web development stack. This repository is designed to document core concepts, production-grade tools, integrations, workflows, and architectural patterns used by professional developers building scalable and high-performance applications.

---

## Overview

This repository captures a wide spectrum of modern web development practices, ranging from frontend engineering to backend architecture, third-party integrations, DevOps workflows, and deployment pipelines. It is meant to serve as both a self-reference for ongoing projects and a showcase of practical understanding for professional opportunities.

---

## Objectives

- Maintain a centralized, structured record of tools, techniques, and best practices across the full stack.
- Document production-level workflows used in real-world projects.
- Track evolving technologies and design patterns relevant to 2025 and beyond.
- Serve as a reliable technical reference when building or reviewing advanced systems.
- Demonstrate deep, system-level thinking to collaborators, interviewers, and contributors.

## Topics Covered

### Frontend Development

- Advanced usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
- Component-driven development using React.
- Framework-level architecture with Next.js 13/14 (App Router, server/client components, metadata, layout patterns).
- State management patterns with Zustand and React Query.
- Frontend performance optimization, lazy loading, and code splitting.

### Backend Engineering

- RESTful API design, GraphQL basics, and type-safe communication with tRPC.
- Database management with PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, and Drizzle ORM.
- Authentication strategies including JWT, OAuth2, Clerk, and NextAuth.
- Secure architecture patterns for session handling, RBAC/ABAC, and rate limiting.

### Tooling and Integrations

- Backend-as-a-service (BaaS) with Supabase.
- Payment integration with Stripe.
- Caching and real-time features using Redis (Upstash).
- Vector database and AI-based functionality using Pinecone.
- File handling and media uploads with UploadThing.

### DevOps and Deployment

- Docker-based local and production environments.
- Deployment workflows with Vercel, Netlify, and AWS (EC2, S3, RDS).
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- Environment configuration and secret management.

### Architecture and Patterns

- Microservices vs Monolith vs Serverless trade-offs.
- Monorepo vs Polyrepo structuring and toolchain decisions.
- Application layering, code modularity, and folder organization.
- Caching strategies (Redis, HTTP, client-side).
- CSP (Content Security Policy), security headers, and CORS.

### Productivity and Development Workflow

- VS Code configuration and plugin recommendations.
- CLI shortcuts, Git aliases, and terminal productivity tips.
- Structured project bootstrapping for consistency and scalability.
- Testing and debugging methodologies.
